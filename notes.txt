i suspect the reason half the pico songs are gone, are gone because i replaced all of the metadata files.
try modding each file seperately to your vanilla copy.

the results screen is broken, i tried replacing the .xml file, but no luck.

protect yo nuts is still in the freeplay menu, so fix that.

last night you should have decided how to deal with pico's weapon, so hope you figured that out.
THIS SHOULD BE FINAL PRIORITY!
